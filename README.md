### If you're using SciNet's JupyterHub System


1. Log into on the [scinet jupyterhub website](njupyter.scinet.utoronto.ca)

2. First time only: add the course's conda env to your conda envs list:

Open up a terminal from the jupyterhub landing page

```bash
module load intelpython3
conda config --append envs_dirs /scinet/course/ss2020/8_brainnetwork/env
```

Return the the landing page and refresh the browser. You should see the `ss2020_tvb` option now when clicking the `new` menu on the top right

3. Also first time only: clone the github repo for the course in a terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnGriffiths/ScinetSS2020_BrainNetworkModelling
```

4. Navigate to the `notebooks` folder in the downloaded github repo folder, and open up the course notebooks 


### If you're using Binder

Click on the `Open In Binder` badge above, and wait patiently for the image and environment to be built and initiated. 


### If you're using Google Colab

Click on the `Open In Colabr` badge above, and wait patiently for the environment to be initiated. 

Note - in google colab you need to `pip install` non-standard libraries. Each of the notebooks has a commented out section that needs to be un-commented and run in order to make the libraries available on Colab.
