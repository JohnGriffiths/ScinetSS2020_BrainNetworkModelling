### If you're using SciNet's JupyterHub System


1. Log into on the [scinet jupyterhub website](njupyter.scinet.utoronto.ca)

2. First time only: add the course's conda env to your conda envs list:

Open up a terminal from the jupyterhub landing page

```bash
module load intelpython3
conda config --append envs_dirs /scinet/course/ss2020/8_brainnetwork/env
```

Return the the landing page and refresh the browser. You should see the `ss2020_tvb` option now when clicking the `new` menu on the top right

3. Also first time only: clone the github repo for the course in a terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnGriffiths/ScinetSS2020_BrainNetworkModelling
```

4. Navigate to the `notebooks` folder in the downloaded github repo folder, and open up the course notebooks 


### If you're running locally on your machine

Mooch on over to the [scwg python neuroimaging course github repo](https://github.com/jerdra/scwg2018_python_neuroimaging) and follow the alternative setup instructions in the README. You'll have to make a few (fairly obvious) adaptions, namely replacing the url of that repo with the url of this one.
